    "Explanation of Forecast Results\n",
    "1. ADF Test for Stationarity\n",
    "Before forecasting, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was conducted to check for stationarity of the time series data. The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the series has a unit root (is non-stationary).\n",
    "\n",
    "ADF Statistic: This value needs to be more negative than the critical values for the series to be considered stationary.\n",
    "p-value: A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning the series is stationary.\n",
    "In this case, if the p-value is high (greater than 0.05), the series is non-stationary, requiring differencing to make it stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Differencing\n",
    "Since the series may not be stationary, differencing was applied. Differencing the series helps to stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, thus eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ARIMA Model\n",
    "An ARIMA model was fitted to the differenced series. The order of the ARIMA model (p, d, q) used was (1, 1, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "p (autoregressive order): Number of lag observations included in the model.\n",
    "d (difference order): Number of times that the raw observations are differenced.\n",
    "q (moving average order): Size of the moving average window.\n",
    "The model was then fitted to the data, and a summary of the model fit was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Residuals Analysis\n",
    "The residuals of the fitted model were plotted to check for any remaining patterns. Ideally, the residuals should look like white noise (i.e., they should be normally distributed around zero with no autocorrelation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots of the residuals were also examined to ensure no significant autocorrelations remained in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Forecasting\n",
    "The model was used to forecast future values (number of surgical readmissions) for the next 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Forecasted Values: These are the predicted numbers of surgical readmissions for the next 12 months beyond the last observed date in the dataset.\n",
    "    Forecast Dates: These were generated to match the forecasted values for visualization purposes.\n",
    "6. Plotting Forecast\n",
    "A plot was created to visualize both the original time series data and the forecasted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Original Data: This is plotted up to the last observed date.\n",
    "    Forecasted Data: This is plotted for the 12 months following the last observed date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of the Forecast Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The solid line represents the historical number of surgical readmissions.\n",
    "The dotted line or extended solid line represents the forecasted readmissions for the next 12 months.\n",
    "This visualization helps to understand the expected trend and potential changes in surgical readmissions in the future based on historical data.\n",
    "The results indicate the model's prediction of the number of surgical readmissions for the next year, which can be used for planning and resource allocation in healthcare facilities. The reliability of these forecasts depends on the accuracy of the ARIMA model and the assumption that future patterns will follow historical trends."
